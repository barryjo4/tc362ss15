<p>
My family is the most important thing in my life.  Whenever I need something, whether it is help with homework or a question of an illness or injury, they are always there for me.   A few years ago, tragedy hit my family when my cousin died.  My mother’s family was in shock.  The death was so unexpected it caught my entire family off guard.  That day will forever be engraved in my mind.  That fateful day had affected us ever since.  Another cousin of mine recently wrote an essay at Michigan State of the effect the death of my cousin had on our family.  It made me think of how lucky I am to have such a compassionate family.
